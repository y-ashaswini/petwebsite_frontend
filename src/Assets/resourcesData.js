      "Neutering animals is important to control the population of stray cats and dogs as there are not enough resources to care for all of them. Animal Birth Control programs involve sterilization which is a common surgery and includes vaccinating against rabies. Neutering can reduce unwanted behaviors such as aggression and territorial fights. Both male and female animals can be neutered but priority is given to females, and the animal must be at least 6 months old, not feeding offspring, and not pregnant. It's essential to treat any visible health issues before neutering. Vaccinating the animal 15 days before neutering is recommended. Initiating and curating animal birth control programs for community animals is necessary as the government is not capable of conducting these programs for all stray animals.",

      "b) Rent/Make a trap",
      "A professional trap is the easiest way to catch a non-friendly cat. It works such that you place the food inside a special cage (raw meat works best), and leave the cat alone. Cat then feels comfortable being alone (may take time for them to brave up, especially if they are not hungry), enters the trap to get the food, and the trap automatically closes.",

      "4. One of the volunteers also owns such a trap and can lend it to people. Please donâ€™t call him, WhatsApp only: +91 99800 72775",
      "Tips:",
      "Usually, organizations that rent out traps require one to come in person to pick up and drop off the trap. However, in emergencies, one may try to request paying the deposit online, signing the documents online and send dunzo / swiggy genie / an empty auto through ola or uber to pick up and drop the trap. Such requests were accommodated in some cases to save time.",
      "The deposit is charged because such traps are quite costly, and some people are not very responsible and donâ€™t give back the trap or donâ€™t take care of it properly.",
      "However, in emergencies, one may request to leave oneâ€™s passport as a deposit instead of money or request people to volunteer and help pay this refundable deposit through various WhatsApp and Facebook groups.",
      "A similar trap can be made by using a standard cage (that can be borrowed from a volunteer or a pet parent in one of the WhatsApp/Facebook groups), tying a long rope to the door, leaving the food inside, and waiting from a distance for the cat to enter the cage. Once all 4 legs of the cat are firmly inside the cage, one has to pull the rope fast and close the door.",
      "If there is any vacant room nearby that the cat can potentially enter if one throws the chicken inside â€” the same mechanism can be done with a room instead of a cage by tying the rope to the roomâ€™s door. However, do not enter the room on your own. Cornered cats can get very aggressive. Seek help! Many transportation people whose contacts are provided below could help.",
      "There are also a few videos on YouTube that show how to hand-make different cat traps. I have personally never tried any so canâ€™t vouch for their efficiency, but leaving the link here just in case someone finds it useful.",

So please do not hesitate to drive the animal there directly even if no one picks up the phone. I have personally had many great experiences with CUPA Trauma Center, and would strongly recommend everyone to use their services. Usually, every animal leaving the CUPA Trauma Center facility after treatment is also neutered and vaccinated for free. Just make sure you inform the center that you would like to get the cat neutered and vaccinated if it is not already done. In the unlikely case you are told that there is simply not enough boarding space for a cat (as cats have to be kept separately from dogs) â€” offer a solution of providing a crate in which the cat can be kept at CUPA Trauma Centerâ€™s facility. Itâ€™s easy to arrange for it, there are many WhatsApp groups with pet parents and volunteers who would be happy to lend you a crate for this purpose.",

Check fees for each procedure advised and make a call on whether or not to get it done.
